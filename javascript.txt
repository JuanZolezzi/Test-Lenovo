Test JavaScript 

1- Create a function that receives an array of positive integers and returns an array with only the input’s pair numbers.
For example:
[INPUT]  array = [1 2 3 4];
[OUTPUT] array = [2, 4];

2- Create a function that receives a String as parameter and returns a Boolean value indicating if the word is a palindrome* or not.
*a word or group of words that is the same when you read it forwards from the beginning or backwards from the end: "Refer" and "level" are palindromes.
 
3- Create a function that receives two numbers and shows the prime numbers between them (it includes both number)
If the function received 3 and 15 as the numbers, you should return something like:
3, 5, 7, 11, 13
 
4- Create a simple page with a button, that when clicked it updates the counter next to it.

4- If you had to represent, using JS data types, this list:
Large blue car - Small Red car - Large Blue car - Large Red car – Medium Blue car – Small Red car – Large Blue car – Medium Red car
How would you do it?
 
5- Using the data from exercise 4. How would you represent it if the data was needed to be accessed easily by color? And how if it was needed to be accessed by size?
